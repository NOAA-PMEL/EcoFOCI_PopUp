# fast-response temperature calibration coefficients, previously named "topside"
# calibration coefficients are not too different than above but lead
# to 10degree offset in temperature during the bottom data timeseries
# using the slow response cal coeffs makes the data better but not sure 
# what the root cause is, so hesitate to make this correction.

### other notes
# sample interval for sst is 3hours but when calculating from short
# timestamp, it will use 1hour (pop-time)+samplenum*1hr
#  *(this is true of ice and bottom too but the samplewrite and sampletake intervals are both 1hr)
