  ### other notes
# This unit was tethered to the top of M8 mooring as a Pop-top, 
# in bottom data phase it was collecting data at 17m depth (approximately)
# in under ice phase it was tethered by 5m of line and should have been at 13m depth (approximately)

# sample interval for sst is 3hours but when calculating from short
# timestamp, it will use 1hour (pop-time)+samplenum*1hr
# *(this is true of ice and bottom too but the samplewrite and sampletake intervals are both 1hr)
