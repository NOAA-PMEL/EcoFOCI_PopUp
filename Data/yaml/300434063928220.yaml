### other notes
# comparing onboard clock to gps seems to indicate a 7hr error in clocks (pc+7 = gps)
### other notes
# sample interval for sst is 3hours but when calculating from short
# timestamp, it will use 1hour (pop-time)+samplenum*1hr
#  *(this is true of ice and bottom too but the samplewrite and sampletake intervals are both 1hr)
