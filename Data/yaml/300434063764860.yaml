### other notes
# sample interval for sst is 3hours but when calculating from short
# timestamp, it will use 1hour (pop-time)+samplenum*1hr
# *(this is true of ice and bottom too but the samplewrite and sampletake intervals are both 1hr)
# pressure sensor is non - standard, converted value needs to be multiplied by 3 as the conversion equation was initially designed for a 10bar sensor
