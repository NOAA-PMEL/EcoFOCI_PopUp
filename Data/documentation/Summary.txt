The data from the Arduino-controlled pop-up floats begins in 2015 and will end in 2022. 
PMEL accomplished 6 seasons of deployments of prototype and pilot test pop-up floats; 
simultaneously developing the engineering of the floats and acquiring novel data.

2015 n=2 Gen1 SAT-Tag prototypes were deployed in July 2015 near Pt. Barrow in the Chukchi Sea. 
Data from this deployment spans from 7/16/15 to 4/4/16.
The first prototype deployment consisted of 2 hardhat floats epoxied with SAT-Tags
from the University of St. Andrews marine mammal research lab attached to an anchor
via a corrosive link that eroded after a few days. The deployments took place on 7/15/15 and 7/16/15
from the USCGC Healy, HE15-01. The SAT-tag prototypes were deployed East and West of Pt. Barrow. 
They collected depth, temperature, and PAR data at bottom, on profile and at surface.

2017 n=5 Gen2 Arduino-controlled pop-up floats were deployed in September 2017 near M5 in the Bering Sea.
Data from this deployment spans from 9/27/17 - 5/30/18
5 floats were deployed, but only 4 transmitted data back via Iridium SBD. All floats
were deployed from NOAA Ship Oscar Dyson on cruise DY17-08. They were programed with 
Sub Sea Sonics burn-wire release mechanisms to "rise" progressively on March 1st, 5th, 10th and 15th. 
These floats collected depth, temperature and PAR data at bottom, on profile, and at surface. 

2018 n=5 Gen3 Arduino-controlled pop-up floats were deployed in August-September 2018 near M5, C12, C10 and C2.
5 floats were deployed, but only 4 transmitted data back via Iridium SBD. All floats on this deployment 
had a camera and a PAR sensor. Float 1240 had a fluorometer and recovered under-ice fluorescence sigal and 
daily low-resolution camera images from 5/1/2019 - 6/29/2019. This data was used to strenghten the
multiple production layer (MPL) hypothesis outlined in "Seasonal patterns of near-bottom chlorophyll
fluorescence in the eastern Chukchi Sea" authored by Stabeno, Mordy & Sigler in 2020.

2019 n=5 Gen3.1 Arduino-controlled floats were deployed in September 2019 
near St. Lawrence and M5 in the Bering Sea. 4 were deployed but only 3 transmitted data. 
Data from these deployments span from 10/1/2019 - 03/10/2019 , and only include partial bottom phase data. 
The floats from this Gen3.1 were modified to accomodate a cheaper release mechanism and resulted in being 
overballasted. The sbd messages struggled to transmit with the antennae too low to the water or continually
submerging in rough sea state. This was the first year the floats were programmed to release in late October in the Bering Sea, 
a time and place notorious for rough weather. 
In addition to the pop-up floats, one pop-top float was attached to mooring 19BS-8A (engineering s/n 219, imei 4010
19BSpoptop-8A (imei 4010) broke free from the mooring and transmitted data in February 2021.

2020 n=15 Gen3.1 Arduino-controlled pop-up floats were deployed July-October 2020, 
n=13 in the Bering and n=2 in the Chukchi at C2 and C12. The floats deployed in the Chukchi at C2 and C12
were outfitted with depth, temperature, PAR, fluorometer and camera. 
Float 4230 released 3/1/2021 and 9200 released 4/15/2021. Both floats transmitted data! The 13 floats deployed in the Bering Sea
will release from their anchors simultaneously on 9/15/2021. 

2021 n=6 Gen3.2 Arduino-controlled floats will be deployed in September 2021
