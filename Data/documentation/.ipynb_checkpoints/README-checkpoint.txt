The data from the Arduino-controlled pop-up floats begins in 2015 and will end in 2022. 
PMEL accomplished 6 seasons of deployments of prototype and pilot test pop-up floats; 
simultaneously developing the engineering of the floats and acquiring novel data.

n=2 Gen1 SAT-Tag prototypes were deployed in July 2015 near Pt. Barrow in the Chukchi Sea. 
Data from this deployment spans from 7/16/15 to 4/4/16.
The first prototype deployment consisted of 2 hardhat floats epoxied with SAT-Tags
from the University of St. Andrews marine mammal research lab attached to an anchor
via a corrosive link that eroded after a few days. The deployments took place on 7/15/15 and 7/16/15
from the USCGC Healy, HE15-01. The SAT-tag prototypes were deployed East and West of Pt. Barrow. 
They collected depth, temperature, and PAR data at bottom, on profile and at surface.

n=5 Gen2 Arduino-controlled pop-up floats were deployed in September 2017 near M5 in the Bering Sea.
Data from this deployment spans from 9/27/17 - 5/30/18
5 floats were deployed, but only 4 transmitted data back via Iridium SBD. All floats
were deployed from NOAA Ship Oscar Dyson on cruise DY17-08. They were programed with 
Sub Sea Sonics burn-wire release mechanisms to "rise" progressively on March 1st, 5th, 10th and 15th. 
These floats collected depth, temperature and PAR data at bottom, on profile, and at surface. 

n=5 Gen3 Arduino-controlled pop-up floats were deployed in August-September 2018 near M5, C12, C10 and C2.
5 floats were deployed, but only 4 transmitted data back via Iridium SBD. All floats on this deployment 
had a camera and a PAR sensor. Float 1240 had a fluorometer and recovered under-ice fluorescence sigal and 
daily low-resolution camera images from 5/1/2019 - 6/29/2019. This data was used to strenghten the
multiple production layer (MPL) hypothesis outlined in "Seasonal patterns of near-bottom chlorophyll
fluorescence in the eastern Chukchi Sea" authored by Stabeno, Mordy & Sigler in 2020.

n=4 Gen3.1 Arduino-controlled pop-up floats were deployed in September 2019 
near St. Lawrence and M5 in the Bering Sea. 4 were deployed but only 3 transmitted data. 
Data from these deployments span from 10/1/2019 - 03/10/2019 , and only include partial bottom phase data. 
The floats from this Gen3.1 were modified to accomodate a cheaper release mechanism and resulted in being 
overballasted. The sbd messages struggled to transmit with the antennae too low to the water or continually
submerging in rough sea state. 

n=15 Gen3.1 Arduino-controlled pop-up floats were deployed July-October 2020, 
n=13 in the Bering and n=2 in the Chukchi at C2 and C12. The floats deployed in the Chukchi at C2 and C12
were outfitted with depth, temperature, PAR, fluorometer and camera. 
Float 4230 released 3/1/2021 and 9200 released 4/15/2021. Currently the C2 and C12 sites are ice-covered,
we are awaiting break-up to see if the floats surface and transmit. The 13 floats deployed in the Bering Sea
will release from their anchors simultaneously on 9/15/2021. 

n=4 Gen3.2 Arduino-controlled pop-up floats will be deployed in September 2021
