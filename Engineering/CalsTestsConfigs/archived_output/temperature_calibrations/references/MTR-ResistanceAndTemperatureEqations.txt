Lines from MTR4K_files macro that calculate resistance and temperature from raw "counts" saved as hex numbers
data files downloaded from MTR

** note ** PMEL version uses log base 10 rather than natural log (see MTR manual)


' equasion to calculate resistance from MTR T counts (either scale)
        temp_res(nset) = (16 * 10 ^ 8) / (iTscale * TempCounts(nset))
        
' see page 558 of VB reference manual for explanation of deriving Log10 from natural log
        log10_resistance = Log(temp_res(nset)) / Log(10#)
        temp_degC(nset) = (1# / (shh_a + (shh_b * log10_resistance) + _
                             (shh_c * (log10_resistance ^ 3)))) - 273.15
