#The following constants are for temperature bath calibrations: 
#bottom sample interval is set to one sample every 30 seconds, no ice, profile or sst files are needed
#for tempcal yaml, keep all temperature probe coefficients (coef) at 1000, since actual calibration coefficients are very small numbers close to zero, keeping these at 1000 will
