Deployment Schedule:
--PHASE 1 (ON BOTTOM)--
 -This mode starts at the scheduled Start Time.
  Unit will start sampling [Feb 12 2021 20:00:00] and take a sample every (0h,0m,30s)
--PHASES 2 AND 3 (WAIT FOR AND COLLECT PROFILE)--
 -This mode starts just before the scheduled Release Time.
  Release Expected [Mar 03 2040 20:00:00] (<--Set Burn Wire Release for this exact time/date.)
  Unit will wake up  (2h,0m,0s) before scheduled release and wait for profile.
  Start of profile will be triggered by a change in depth of (1 meters).
  Profile will sample at 4 Hz for (0h,1m,30s) seconds before proceeding to phase 3. 
  If unit does not sense the release within  (4h,0m,0s) of waking it will assume it missed the profile and proceed to phase 3.
--PHASES 4 AND 5 (UNDER ICE AND TRANSMIT DATA)--
 -This mode starts after profile has been collected (or missed).
  Unit will take a sample every (1h,0m,0s) and take an image once a day.
  Unit will search for GPS satellites for (0h,2m,0s)  after every sample.
  If unit does successfully find a GPS satellite, it will attempt to send all collected data back in the following order:
    1-File Summary, 2-Profile Data, 3-Under Ice Data, 4-Bottom Data, 5-Daily Images
  If any iridium messages send successfully, it will continue sending until one message fails and make the next attempt to send in (0h,20m,0s)
  Otherwise, if no messages send, the unit will take the next sample and attempt to send again in (1h,0m,0s)
--PHASE 6 (SURFACE DRIFTER)--
 -This mode starts after all data has finished sending.
  Unit will take a sample every (3h,0m,0s) and search for a GPS fix for (0h,2m,0s) after every sample.
  Unit will attempt to send any new data regardless of whether a GPS fix was found
