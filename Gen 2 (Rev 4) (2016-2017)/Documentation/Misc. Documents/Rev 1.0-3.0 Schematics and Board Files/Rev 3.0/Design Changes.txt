Labeled R5,7,9,11 properly with 3.74K

Renamed U10 to JP3

Renamed D1 to JP0

Labeled C3 properly as 0.1 uF

Added JP5 and J5 to BOM (header and connector for thermistor)

Labeled/named U21 properly (LT1129 5v regulator)

Changed U5 from M74VHC1GT125 to NL17SZ07DFT2G (Used wrong IC for 5V to 3v3 logic shift)

Changed Test Point size to 0.040"

Changed Test Points to Red, Black, and Yellow

Updated BOM for temp circuit resistors - R12,15,16,13 (switched package sizes)

Routed Pin 3 to +5V on U18 (3v3 regulator ENABLE wasn't connected)

Changed C3 to VDD input of U2, Temperature ADC (Was connected to Vin-)

Changed NPN transistors (T1-T4) to PNP Transistors (Q3-Q6)

Changed headers for all sensors to Molex 70543

Moved Iridium to Bottom of PCB

Changed Iridium Power and Iridium OnOff Pins

Added logic gate to adxl345 SPI lines

Added Diode to Arduino +5V

Changed temperature circuit

Changed BOM for temp circuit

*Use taller female headers for Arduino ICSP and Iridium Module
