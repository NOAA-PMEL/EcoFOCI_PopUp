  Temp Sensor ADC Val: 5912 (approx 23.12 C)
  Temp Ref    ADC Val: 5499 (approx 24.76 C)
  PAR  Sensor ADC Val: 4849 (approx 0.46 umol/(m2s))
  100m Pressure Sensor Val: 16597 (approx 0.65 m)
  30m  Pressure Sensor Val: 16455 (approx 0.07 m)
  Accelerometer Reading: -995.3 (approx 174.4 degrees from vertical)

Offset values for post-calibration:
  Pressure Offset: 16384
  Temperature Offset: 21000
  Temperature Reference Offset: 5600
  PAR Offset: 4700

Deployment Schedule:
--PHASE 1--
  Unit will start sampling [Apr 11 2017 14:00:00] and take a sample every (1h,0m,0s)
--PHASE 2--
  Release Expected [Apr 13 2017 12:00:00] (<--Set Burn Wire Release for this exact time/date.)
  Unit will wake up  (1h,0m,0s) before scheduled release and wait for profile.
  Start of profile will be triggered by a change in depth of (2 meters).
  Profile will sample at 4 Hz for (0h,1m,0s) seconds before proceeding to phase 3. 
  If unit does not sense the release within  (2h,0m,0s) it will assume it missed the profile and proceed to phase 3.
--PHASE 3--
  Unit will assume it is under ice until [Apr 14 2017 09:00:00]
  Unit will take a sample every (1h,0m,0s) and search for GPS location only once a day to conserve battery power.
--PHASE 4--
  Unit will no longer assume it is under ice after [Apr 14 2017 09:00:00]
  Unit will take a sample and search for GPS location every (1h,0m,0s)
  Unit will search for GPS (1 times) for (0h,2m,0s) with (0h,0m,20s)  between each attempt to confirm a lock.
  If unit does successfully find a GPS lock, it will attempt to send data back in the following order:
  1-File Summary, 2-Profile Data, 3-Under Ice Data, 4-Bottom Data
  If any messages send successfully, the unit will automatically make another attempt in (0h,5m,0s)
  Otherwise, the unit will return to sampling and searching for GPS every (1h,0m,0s)
