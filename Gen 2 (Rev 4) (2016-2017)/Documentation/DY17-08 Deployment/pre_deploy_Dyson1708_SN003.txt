Deployment Schedule:
--PHASE 1--
  Unit will start sampling [Sep 27 2017 00:00:00] and take a sample every (6h,0m,0s)
--PHASE 2--
  Release Expected [Mar 10 2018 15:00:00] (<--Set Burn Wire Release for this exact time/date.)
  Unit will wake up  (2h,0m,0s) before scheduled release and wait for profile.
  Start of profile will be triggered by a change in depth of (3 meters).
  Profile will sample at 4 Hz for (0h,1m,30s) seconds before proceeding to phase 3. 
  If unit does not sense the release within  (4h,0m,0s) of waking it will assume it missed the profile and proceed to phase 3.
--PHASE 3--
  Unit will assume it is under ice until [Mar 10 2018 18:00:00]
  Unit will take a sample every (1h,0m,0s) and search for GPS location only once a day to conserve battery power.
--PHASE 4--
  Unit will no longer assume it is under ice after [Mar 10 2018 18:00:00]
  Unit will take a sample and search for GPS location every (1h,0m,0s)
  Unit will search for GPS (1 times) for (0h,2m,0s) with (0h,0m,20s)  between each attempt to confirm a lock.
  If unit does successfully find a GPS lock, it will attempt to send data back in the following order:
  1-File Summary, 2-Profile Data, 3-Under Ice Data, 4-Bottom Data
  If any messages send successfully, the unit will automatically make another attempt in (0h,5m,0s)
  Otherwise, the unit will return to sampling and searching for GPS every (1h,0m,0s)

**Check all settings, take a screenshot of this dialog, and disconnect from USB when ready.**
